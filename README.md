# 🤖 Mental Health Supporter Chatbot (AI-Based)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Mental Health Supporter Chatbot** is a text-based, AI-assisted system designed to provide *empathetic emotional support* to users by analyzing their messages using **Emotion Detection** and **Sentiment Analysis**.

The chatbot does **not diagnose**, **does not replace therapy**, and **does not provide medical advice**. Instead, it aims to:
- Understand how the user is feeling  
- Respond empathetically  
- Track daily emotional patterns  
- Generate a simple daily emotional summary  
- Maintain a history of past summaries  

This makes it useful as a **self-reflection tool** and a **supportive conversational companion** rather than a clinical system.
